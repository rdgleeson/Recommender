This program takes in two files as command line inputs, a training set and a
test set. It recommends each user in the test set a list of 5 items based
off the data in the training set. The third input determines the similarity
function to use, either cosine or euclidean. Cosine sim is the default.

This program was originally created to recommend artists.
